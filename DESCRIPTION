Title: Clustering Deviation Index (CDI)
Description: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to explore cellular variation. The analysis of scRNA-seq data often starts from clustering cells into subpopulations. This initial step has a high impact on downstream analyses, and hence it is important to be accurate. However, there have not been unsupervised metric designed for scRNA-seq to evaluate clustering performance. Hence, we propose clustering deviation index (CDI), an unsupervised metric based on the modeling of scRNA-seq UMI counts to evaluate clustering of cells.
